Over the years, India has been governed by different rulers and dynasties, finally culminating in the British Raj. Several dynasties such as the Mauryas, Guptas, Cholas, Chalukyas, and Pallavas have left an indelible mark on the history of the country. South India is home to some famous ancient temples that are stunning to behold. In the East, places like Bodh Gaya where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment, Sanchi Stupa and the Nalanda University still hold remnants of the rich past. Aurangabad, in Maharashtra, was the capital of the Tughlaqs and the Daulatabad Fort is one of the most famous attractions of the Tughlaq era.

Soon after, Kakatiyan king was informed about the same, and he gave the order to build a mud fort around the idol. The fort came to be known as "Golla Konda" which meant Shepherd's Hill in Telugu. The Golconda fort was erected in the year 1143 under the Kakatiya Dynasty. However, it rose to prominence when it came under the rule of Qutub Shahi Dynasty during the 16th century, i.e. when Quli Qutub Shah declared his independence from the Bahmani Sultanate in 1518. The striking fort since then expanded from a mud fortress to a lofty structure to having a 10 km outer wall.

It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale. The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete. Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humayun%27s_Tomb"><input type="button" value="READ MORE" class="button"></a></b></p>

        <p><b>Mehrangarh, also known as Mehran Fort was built by Rao Jodha in 1459 in Jodhpur, is one of the largest forts in the country. It is situated at the top of a 410 feet elevated hill and guarded by massive walls. One of the most easily recognisable forts in Jodhpur, it has appeared in many Hollywood and Bollywood productions such as The Lion King, The Dark Knight Rises, and the more recent - Thugs of Hindostan. The entrance of the fort, atop a hill, is majestic and has seven gates. These are called Victory Gate, Fateh Gate, Gopal Gate, Bhairon Gate, Dedh Kamgra Gate, Marti Gate and finally Loha Gate. Each of these was built at different times and serves a very specific purpose. While one still has marks of cannon balls being hit on it, the other has spikes that can protect it from elephant and animal attacks. However, Victory Gate was built to commemorate the win of Maharaja Man Singh over Jaipur and Bikaner armies. The fort also has opulent palaces such as the Sheesh Mahal (Glass Palace) and Phool Mahal (Rose Palace).<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrangarh"><input type="button" value="READ MORE" class="button"></a></b></p>

        <p><b>Built in 1156 by King Rawal Jaisal, Jaisalmer Fort dominates the countryside in the far northwestern corner of Rajasthan, near the border of India and Pakistan. The magnificent complex, also known as Sonar Kila ("Golden Fort") for its gleaming golden sandstone walls and buildings, flourished on the east-west caravan route connecting India and Central Asia to the Middle East and North Africa. Merchants built elaborately designed havelis among the numerous palaces, temples, bazaars, and residences inside the walls of the complex. The superb architecture within the fort was protected by double fortification walls and circular bastions, key physical components used for defense and battle. Additional features of the fort include a pitching wall to hold the clay soil of the hill in place, a toe wall, and the mori, a pathway between the inner and outer fortification walls that allowed soldiers and horses to move throughout the structure in times of war.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaisalmer_Fort"><input type="button" value="READ MORE" class="button"></a></b></p>

        <p><b>The mighty edifice of Fort William is situated in the city of Kolkata, on the eastern bank of the  Hooghly River. Built in the year 1696, the fort is named after King William III and was the first stronghold of the British in the country. The magnificent structure is spread over 70.9 acres and is embellished with hundreds of arched windows that overlook lush green gardens. Meticulous stonework adorns the surface of the building and it took as long as took ten years to reach completion. However, it was soon realized that the building had a few loopholes, and a new octagonal building was constructed whose foundation was laid by Sir Robert Clive. Over the course of its existence, Fort William has served a number of purposes, each of which was in stark contrast to the other. Initially, it comprised of wings and an inner bastion where prisoners were hauled which is why it was known as 'the black hole of Calcutta'.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_William,_India"><input type="button" value="READ MORE" class="button"></a></b></p>

It was thus originally known as Ochterlony Monument. However, in August 1969, this monument was re-dedicated to the memory of the martyrs of India’s struggle for independence and was renamed Shaheed Minar (martyrs’ monument).<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheed_Minar,_Kolkata"><input type="button" value="READ MORE" class="button"></a></b></p>

        <p><b>The Writer’s Building was built in Kolkata in 1777 to accommodate ‘writers’ for the East India Company. Later the building became the administrative center for the British rule in the city. The revolutionary activities of groups like Bengal Volunteers and Jugantar inspired the youths of Bengal. Many youngsters joined the campaign of executing the oppressive British officers to strike terror in the heart of the British Empire. On 8th December 1930, three Indian revolutionaries, Benoy Basu, Badal Gupta, and Dinesh Gupta, dressed in English clothes, entered the Writer’s Building. They shot Lt Col NS Simpson, the Inspector General of the Kolkata Prison, infamous for his brutalities over political prisoners. A gun battle followed in which British officers Twynam, Prentice, and Nelson were seriously injured. Overpowered by the police, Badal ingested Cyanide, and Benoy and Dinesh shot themselves. Dinesh, the only survivor, was hanged on 7th July 1931 at the mere age of 19. The sacrifices of Badal, Benoy, and Dinesh at the Writer’s Building struck terror into the hearts of British officers. Their courageous venture at a colonial building immortalized them and became an inspiration for the patriotic hearts of the country.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers%27_Building"><input type="button" value="READ MORE" class="button"></a></b></p>
